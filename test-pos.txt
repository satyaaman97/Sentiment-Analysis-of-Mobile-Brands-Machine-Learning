@SamsungMobileUS be reaching so hard with these trash commercials. They want to be @Apple so bad, they put them in their commercials. They say if people aren’t hating on you, you not doing something right.
Is that Lily and James Potter?
I bought my @SamsungMobileUS #GalaxyS7Edge from @TMobile  on day 1.  Had to exchange it due to problem with it automatically restarting often. Now it is 22 months old and I have the same issue.  Am I just out of luck?  There must be a fix
My Note 5 worked fine with no problems during the Note 7 situation so I wasn't worried. And I'm wrote this on my Note 8 that also has no problems so...yea.
Haha love it!!!

That "High Powered Calculator" Is a laptop! you can google out what a laptop is in your spare time. but what you should know is that laptop there can easily buy 2 "Galaxy Note 5" and have some change left. and I used my phone to take that picture. so what is your point?
so is it @corning or @SamsungMobileUS at fault? been #samsung loyal and solid screens through #note5. but the #s7edge and #note8 both have broken glass/screen damage from 1 foot drops. either make your screens what they used to be or stop advertising #gorillaglass. cc: @jenesee
also btw @Corning @SamsungMobileUS the #note7 had wonderful glass, but you recalled 2 of them. i actually threw my #note5 at a wall without damage to show how awesome #gorillaglass was. @jenesee
I have spent much time with them. They are sorry for the error on Samsung's part but unable to fix...they asked me to please keep calling back and in time they can get my bill corrected. My job to keep calling,  not their job to just fix the error.

@espn do ur advertisers know that ur app sucks and is freezing up on THEIR ads that they BOUGHT for your crappy app?!??! Consumers arent able to do what we do bc of your social media shortcomings.  @NCAA @ATT @Progressive @SamsungMobileUS yall should pull ur ads until its fixed!
Hey @SamsungMobileUS @SamsungUS when do you think you guys will provide support for #gear watches with #iOS efficiently? Can’t update #gear (still stuck with 2.3 on my s3 frontier) and always have Bluetooth issues! Why?
If you cannot provide reliable experience with #iOS then I would suggest you to remove the support completely as it is very irritating to have half-baked support! kthxbye. #samsunggear

Wow! Can we see some video? Well done, you are a braver man than i!
@SamsungMobileUS My friend captured @tiesto tonight on his S8. The colors are vibrant and image clear. My iPhone 6+ was pixelated and dark :/ I think it’s time to make Samsung my primary content creation phone for @WeAreLATech and @WomenInTechShow. Let’s DM  #impressed #samsungpic.twitter.com/UF58xJSaDv
I like your phones but who are these shoe related puns for Samsung marketing team?
Uguale
È strano che ci sia così tanta diversità tra un dispositivo e l'altro. Io con il 6 plus con sicuramente batteria maggiore ma più vecchiotta, con iOS 11.2 faccio circa 6/7 ore di utilizzo.
C'mon @SamsungMobileUS let's make this happen!
Dear @Apple your apology means nothing when you charge me to replace something that isn’t broke. One more reasons my family is making a switch to @SamsungMobileUS phones.
Io ho cambiato la batteria nemmeno un mese fa
Con iOS 11.1 facevo anche io quelle durate
@SamsungMobileUS new Galaxy software update put ads on my screen whenever I try to see my text messages? That's crap! Good way to lose customers
Batteria originale?
TMobile is scamming people with JOD plan now. switching asap
When your son drops your 3 day old new phone and smashes all the back up.... think by now Samsung would have learned the back covers are not fucking durable. Smallest bang and it smashes. Come on @SamsungMobileUS sort it out.

@SamsungMobileUS (2/2) to not screw over customers, unless u guys did and I just haven't had it happen to me, those ppl deserve a big raise (unless of course they are already CEO rich guys exacerbating income inequality) then give them a pat on the back and raise other ppls wages

Just watched the first half of the game online and they are hanging tough with them.
Hey @SamsungMobileUS sometimes one of the earpieces in the earbuds that came with my Galaxy S8+ are louder than the other but not always. Is there a setting to change volume in each earpiece individually?
@SamsungMobileUS I went to the local AT&T store. They said I had to pay off the remaining balance on our fruit phones; which is over $1300. I guess we will wait for the Samsung experience. They also said it’s $300 not $400 for their trade in program. #ideas #drawingboard

@SamsungMobileUS How come the pixel 2 xl runs smoothly and faster than the new iPhone X yet every single phone of your make whether is brand new or few years old is nothing to compare with them in terms of performance.. #SammyLag
I’ve seen this story before @SamsungMobileUS. Erik goes back to @Apple when he realizes how poorly his new phone performs. Lived it myself.

This is great VR headset. Playing Windows MR, SteamVR & Oculus content on beautiful Surface book 2. The beauty and power together, they are creating a reality of joyfulness
C'mon now, we'd never do that to you.pic.twitter.com/knc0cIob3j
what about availability of these in EU?
@SamsungMobileUS I have a big problem, and I about to go to the news. I had a bad experience with your online chat and that person is using my email to register me for stuff online. For instance they made an job search account with Mother F****R as the name. Please contact me.

Hey @SamsungMobileUS may I have a samsung galaxy 8? Pretty please? With a cherry on top?
Thanks to @SamsungMobileUS new update, power saving mode does nothing and my battery jumps from 25% to 12% to 1% over the course of minutes and no numbers in between. Thanks for force slowing your phones jerks

Lmao how in @ThePunisher on Netflix they try to "remove the battery" from phones that clearly don't have removable batteries (looking at you @SamsungMobileUS )
@SamsungMobileUS why do I think the Iphone isn't as good as you guys?
Got a iPhone 5s loaner while my @SamsungMobileUS s8+ is getting fixed and I already miss my phone sm 
you guys are the best.  i will miss evryone
@SamsungMobileUS 5 Years with your products and this past week was the first time I have had to deal with your customer support. To say the least the customer service is terrible. I left Apple for you guys and now Im regretting it.
@SamsungMobileUS you’re commercials are always comparing to @Apple ‘s IPhone yet they never do that to you...just saying.
Everytime i see this samsung commercial i think "whats up with dudes hair." Turns out its to mimic the iphone x notch, damn @SamsungMobileUS yall savage. pic.twitter.com/MijSoDYQSl
Is there really no way to leave a group SMS on Samsung Galaxy? This is beyond frustrating.  @SamsungMobileUS
I already did, and all you guys can offer me is to send it back, AGAIN so you can TRY to fix it AGAIN.....
I love my samsung note 8

@SamsungMobileUS S8’s display in the corners are more curved than Note8’s display, so will the S9 be like the S8 or Note8?
Happy New Year!!! Health & Happiness Always
Part of Me loves the @SamsungMobileUS commercial where they diss @Apple for never changing, but the other part of me thinks it's a little convenient that they skipped over the year that all their phones exploded.

Wuaooo [
@SamsungMobile @SamsungMobileIN #note8 screen cracked with a meagre fall of less than 1 metre. This is pathetic standards and claim of #GorillaGlass is nonsensical. Really not worth investing in such a delicate @SamsungMobileUS #Note8
I am very sorry for your loss.
@AppleSupport wtf with downloading desktop app._. I think I’m changing to @SamsungMobileUS  apple is getting shiti. pic.twitter.com/1L33ZWvSWm

@SamsungMobileUS Thanks for not updating my new 8 that blocked all calls to any one with an iPhone #2hoursatbestbuy #wastedday

@SamsungMobileUS I wish you would list "Browse time" instead of "talk time." Who even cares about "talk time" anymore? #2018 pic.twitter.com/S3Gw79OkK8
@SamsungMobile @SamsungMobileUS I used my old phone to change the AC temp now I am unable to do it #IWantRemote #BringBackRemoteOnMyPhone
I'm so grateful... 2017 was about working on my health and photography, thanks to @SamsungMobileUS for stepping up mobile photography game, and finally meeting all of my heroes from @nbcsvu oh all meeting so many wonderful folks. #blessed #thankyou
@SamsungMobile @SamsungMobileUS Don't see the remote on my new phone please get it back. #IWantRemote #BringBackRemoteOnMyPhone
Happy New Year Wayne! 
I don't know what happened toy Samsung Galaxy 7 but the whole thing doesn't work now. @SamsungMobileUS

@FCC is it legal for @SamsungMobileUS to alter the performance of a device to negatively affect its performance, with obvious motives to persuade you to upgrade ? To me that seems like extortion..
So idk if you have seen @SamsungMobileUS commercial, but this part might have gone over your head... what's up with the hairline? pic.twitter.com/sXrBORiqJp
I'd personally also love it if apps didn't crash every 10 seconds. Kthx.
u @SamsungMobileUS , thynn ndiyanqanda. zange ndayibona leh. Messiah
welp i had Samsung all my life and never had those those problems  my brother has the Note 5 and it works like a charm also the s7 edge plus it works like a charm i have the 6 edge plus and it works beautifully like a charm i think it a manufacturing mistake

Ye, @essential , Gear 360° is just amazing, isn't it.... 

@SamsungMobileUS @SamsungMobile @SamsungUK @essential #essentialphone #Gear360
@SamsungMobileUS @VerizonSupport @Android that update a few days ago was shit.  My phone has been so much slower since then.  It has become unresponsive and will sit on blank screens for upwards of 10 seconds when I do simple things like press back in Reddit or lags when I type
themes for the music player in our life time @SamsungMobileUS
Here’s to a new year filled with health and happiness!
At least your older phones still work and wont slow down ... #ihateapple lelelellel #dodgyapple
Haha.. it's not ppl oriented.. it's #cash oriented.

@SamsungMobileUS what is this junk? How can I make it go away? pic.twitter.com/xjzBnSnELC
@SamsungMobileUS My Note 8 is AMAZING! But... the icon you selected for "Calling Plus" (triangular warning sign with exclamation point) is stupid. The reason should be obvious. PLEASE change it. Thanks, and Happy New Year to you.
...Happy 2018 to you too!
