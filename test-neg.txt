All this scandel about Iphone batteries is not a problem for me.. my new iPhone only lasted 12 months and 6 days before Apple denied service! Now got a Samsung s8+. Much better. Thanks @SamsungMobile. No thanks to @Apple. @garyvee, just because you love Samsung ;)
Samsung must be dying to mock slow iPhones, but it totally shouldn’t

Attention aux offres de remboursements de Samsung GROSSE ARNAQUE, après avoir acheté un Samsung galaxy s7, je fais l'ensemble du dossier de remboursement et envois les pièces justificatives.

dear @SamsungMobile what should i do to claim my 100gb OneDrive? i installed and logged in to my account via my new phone.
@SamsungMobile hi I have the s7 edge . I'm having battery issues . What's the warranty period for batteries
And this is why I can't stand Apple! @SamsungMobile all the way for me 
Only problem I've had with my s8+ is that aspect ratio doesn't suit some apps and websites and lose some of viewable content
@SamsungMobile 
When we will get nougat to samsung c7pro in India
I would expect someone with your perceived level of intelligence to be able to formulate gramatically correct sentences.

@SamsungMobile Galaxy S8 is waterproof but the back glass is so easily broken, even with a case, that it doesn't make sense. Not sure I will buy Samsung anymore if no metal body

Apple is slightly overcharging for its iPhone X so Samsung is more reasonably priced and has more features.
For example Samsung charges £49 for a S8+ LED folio and Apple charges £99 for a iPhone X leather folio. I’m saying this even though I own a iPhone X.
@SamsungMobile It's the last time Samsung has used an industry flaw and the company does not recognize yet to complain that is not good for a company like Samsung

Now is it the best best or just the best cause if it’s just the best then it sucks
Samsung experienced same issue. Batteries posing risk to components. Look at research from Tom’s Guide. They also throttle.
I want a double tap to wake feature in Galaxy s9/+. Even iPhone has it. @SamsungMobile

You have been peddling Samsung for a long while. Children's In Need 2012 ring a bell? Smells like you have some investment in the company. Totally unbiased right Sugar?
And they withdrew them from the market because they were um ... EXPLODING and endangering lives... so your statement is a bit non-sensical.

@SamsungMobile you owe me $91
@SamsungMobile why won’t my smart switch work ? Any ideas
I believed they announced new batteries for all.
Not sure why! I mean, it's definitely not perfect but I tried side by side with Siri and it worked like 100x better.

Like I said "archive" w/ notifications down and it figured out I meant archive the email of the email notification i got. That was amazing to me lol
Just tried it and Google failed on the last three. It did just fine with the app install
Never iPhone
Before I typed that tweet before I was at a 32% battery, after I sent it, I was at 18%. #innovation #GalaxyS7 @SamsungMobile
Just switched from IPhone to pixel. I thought Google assistant was better than Samsung's
@AskLyft @lyft should get @SamsungMobile to pay me for my missed pickup
Yea I wouldn't respond neither if i knew my phone were shit @Apple @SamsungMobile
How comes @Apple reply so fast even if they slow their phones ?? I'm still waiting @SamsungMobile

So @SamsungMobile is not willing to fix or replace a phone that is under warranty... My option is to be without a phone for 14 days and then PAY to have my phone repaired...Why not just go to @Apple and get an #iPhoneX? Unbelievable... Horrible customer service.

As I’m pulling out my hair trying to get my @apple devices to recognize the same ID and password, the @SamsungMobile Galaxy commercial comes on, and my husband and I are both like, “Yeah. Let’s switch.” #screwyouapple
What a joke show!!!
I've never had a problem with my samsung galaxy. Were at s8 plus edge now. Love it. They have the world's first 10nm processor. It's fast and powerful and increases battery efficiency. Plus, there's the ability to expand storage.
And now... my first smart phone. A @SamsungMobile blackjack 2. I believe it was a Windows phone. pic.twitter.com/pTrEWUYwgC
I had this phone and I loved it
Someone keep using my account buys music and games!!

Dear @AppleSupport my iPhone SE is hanging during typing text in what’s app. Now I think apple made me fool. Disgusting @SamsungMobile
So I think its time to realise that apple is earning 5x more than other brands by cheating their customers. Fuck you @AppleSupport @Apple
@AppleSupport 
ADD: shut my phone off w/89% battery life. Turned it on to 65% battery life.

Hey @SamsungMobile
Business coming your way when I return home!  https://twitter.com/1jeffreyholland/status/947630305166290944 …
If the next @SamsungMobile Galaxy has a dual camera, I’m switching to #Android for sure!
Hey @Rogers is my @SamsungMobile #Galaxy #S7Edge going to be upgraded to Nougat? #Samsung #GalaxyS7 #Rogers #2018

@SamsungMobile touché on the apple iPhone attack ad, but you still just jealous they have better phones and sell more!
brooke thats the mistake you have made. Get away from any apple product. They are rubbish. @SamsungMobile much better.
@SamsungMobile @SamsungMobile why my J7 (2016 model) is running slow like hell?? Can you do something???
I said bye bye to the iPhone today thanks to @Apple doing their customers dirty by slowing down old phones when they release new ones. That's uncalled for. Still have to deal with them because the rest of the fam didn't make the switch. Hey @SamsungMobile, I'm home! #SamsungNote8
How does one appeal a blacklisting that comes three weeks after a @SamsungMobile phone was purchased in private sale? Checking imei, ID and getting a receipt did not help me. One day after using for 3 weeks @FidoSolutions SIM would not register on network. What to do with phone?
According to rumours @SamsungMobile  will reveal GALAXY A8 & A8+ 2018 , premium soundbar in CES 2018 and GALAXY S9 in MWC 2018.. hope for the best . @SamMobiles @SamsungMobileIN @SamsungUS @Samsung

@SamsungMobile @SamsungMobileUS I used my old phone to change the AC temp now I am unable to do it #IWantRemote #BringBackRemoteOnMyPhone
@SamsungMobile Thank you for creating a great phone. pic.twitter.com/iUAQVEobge
That stupid peel remote continued to be a nuisance so I moved it to the trash bin and now I can't text? Wtf? @SamsungMobile
dayum.. tbh @SamsungMobile have one of the or the best hardware but the problem is they didn’t  focus on the quality of the software experience(transition & animation) from the start...so they are really left behind. Most of the users judge by the smooth transition. https://twitter.com/iyoursubscriber/status/947694245082566656 …
@SamsungMobile @SamsungMobileUS Don't see the remote on my new phone please get it back. #IWantRemote #BringBackRemoteOnMyPhone

@AppleSupport @Apple 40 minutes into 2018 and I’m still having issues sending messages to Androids. Now you know you fuckers did something SO FUCKEN FIX IT! @Samsung @SamsungMobile looks like I’m in the market for a new phone this year. pic.twitter.com/2KLr1vSBbq

Cool say hello to to exploding batteries, viruses on your phone, and a shittier OS. They all suck bro and last 1-2 years
Just redeemed 100GB of free storage for two years on @onedrive because I have a @SamsungMobile and the app installed? Perfect timing as I just filled the Samsung cloud storage. https://onedrive.com/download pic.twitter.com/F42blXozZM
I never been happier moving to @SamsungMobile Galaxy note 8 an gear S3 watch . Still learning play store though!
Yessssssss love go ahead dear @SamsungMobile has that effect  wait till you see the videos... Wicked!!

New set of Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus renders leaked #TechNews @SamsungMobile @Samsung #S9https://goo.gl/b3KpAv 
Last time I checked iPhones need replacing just as often thanks to the racket they're spearheading and exploding batteries are a thing of the past. Did a bunch of research before pulling the trigger.
IJS my iPhone 5 lasted 2.5 years and is still fine but the new features I upgraded. The way things are now it doesn’t matter.
Worst phones @AppleSupport @Apple while using they stop working gets restart automatically battery gets drained, any help provided? Or it’s better if i switch too @SamsungMobile @Samsung
Is @BlackBerry under other or unknown?? I’m still rocking my @SamsungMobile S7 and my new @Apple iPhone 8s with that new battery throttle future built in!! 2018 is going to be lit!
Samsung will launch next-gen Exynos chip on January 4, likely to power the Galaxy S9.

Been team Samsung since the galaxy 3, so much better my g!
Absolutely. Just a year old @SamsungMobile Galaxy S7 facing depleting battery issues since July 2017 update. Also camera has started to underperform even in day light conditions and low light shoots are badly noisy. It's like being forced to upgrade to S8 or Note 8.
@AppleSupport dear apple i hate you so much I’ll never buy your any product now my mobile is slower than @SamsungMobile bhnchod
It’s super awesome that @Apple advertised the iphones ability to capture life’s precious moments and now when I try to use the camera on my 6S it takes minutes to load up, which is perfect for a father of a toddler. I guess I’ll be buying @SamsungMobile next.
Now @SamsungMobile admits it knows of battery issue on #GalaxyNote8 #GalaxyS8Plushttp://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/samsung-acknowledges-battery-issue-on-galaxy-note-8-galaxy-s8-plus-5006942/ …

Lmao.... after hearing about apples tricks this week, I may have to concur!
2018 is good and all but i think Instagram is paid by Apple to make the android version shitty af. I have a @SamsungMobile S8 and is a flawless phone but the Instagram is so shitty that I sometimes just wanna throw the phone. Happy new year!

@SamsungMobile 
Hi Samsung, I bought my "Note 5"  two years ago.
My battery now is very bad. it discharged quickly. I can't use my mobile for two hours. I spent the money for that!

Thanks, Samsung!
@SamsungMobile do you think you could maybe replace this emoji? - >
